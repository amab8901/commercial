# Before using this app:
1. Create `.env` file in root directory
2. Add the following to the `env` file:

    >STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "pk_test_1234"
    
    >STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "sk_test_1234"

Instead of `pk_test_1234` and `sk_test_1234` in above two lines, add the actual API keys that you find in your Stripe dashboard, which you find in:
    Developers > API keys
